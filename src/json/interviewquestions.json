    "question": "What is the difference between position: absolute and position: relative in CSS?",
    "answer": "Position: absolute and position: relative are both CSS properties that control the positioning of an element, but they have different effects. Position: relative positions an element relative to its normal position in the document flow, while allowing other elements to flow around it. Position: absolute positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, or the document if no ancestor is positioned. Absolute positioning takes an element out of the normal flow of the document and can cause other elements to overlap with it.",
    "tag": "css"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between display: none and visibility: hidden in CSS?",
    "answer": "The display: none property removes an element from the flow of the document, so it takes up no space and is not visible. The visibility: hidden property hides an element but still takes up space and affects the layout of the document. In other words, display: none completely removes the element from the page, while visibility: hidden hides the element but still reserves its space.",

  {
    "question": "What is the difference between inline and block elements in CSS?",
    "answer": "Inline elements are those that only take up as much width as their content and do not start a new line. Examples of inline elements include <a>, <span>, and <strong>. Block elements, on the other hand, take up the full width available to them and start a new line. Examples of block elements include <div>, <p>, and <h1>. Inline elements can be nested inside block elements, but block elements cannot be nested inside inline elements.",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the z-index property in CSS?",
    "answer": "The z-index property determines the stacking order of elements on a web page. An element with a higher z-index value will appear on top of an element with a lower z-index value. The z-index property only applies to positioned elements (i.e., those with position: relative, position: absolute, or position: fixed).",

  {
    "question": "What is the difference between ID and class selectors in CSS?",
    "answer": "ID selectors target a specific HTML element based on its unique ID attribute, using the # symbol. For example, #header { background-color: blue; } would target the element with an ID of 'header'. Class selectors, on the other hand, target one or more HTML elements based on their shared class attribute, using the . symbol. For example, .highlight { background-color: yellow; } would target all elements with a class of 'highlight'. An ID can only be used once on a page, while a class can be used multiple times.",

  },
  {
    "question": "What is VH/VW (viewport height/ viewport width) in CSS?",
    "answer": "VH and VW are CSS units used to measure viewport height and viewport width respectively in percentage form in the responsive design techniques. E.g. If the height of the browser is 1000px, then VH is 1/100 of the height of the viewport that is 1000px*(1/100) = 10px, which is the height of the browser.  The same applies to VW (viewport width).",

  {
    "question": "How is opacity specified in CSS3?",
    "answer": "Opacity is the measure of content transparency. It is measured in the range from 0 to 1. Value 1 means the content is completely opaque. It is not supportable in the internet browser. Also, the 60% of opacity is applicable in the div section where we need to apply the filter property (polyfill) to make it completely opaque.",
    "tag": "css"
  },
  {
    "question": "How does absolute positioning work?",
    "answer": "Absolute positioning is used to place the element which is then removed from the HTML document from the normal workflow without creating any space for the element in the HTML page layout. The element can be positioned respectively to the closest positioned ancestor; otherwise, if the ancestor is not found, the element is placed with respect to the initial container box. The values provided to the top, right, left and bottom determine the final position of the element.",

  },
  {
    "question": "In useEffect, what's the difference between providing no dependency array and an empty one?",
    "answer": "Giving it an empty array acts like componentDidMount as in, it only runs once whereas giving it no second argument acts as both componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate, as in it runs first on mount and then on every re-render.",

  },
  {
    "question": "How does React use Virtual DOM to improve performance?",
    "answer": "React uses a virtual DOM to minimize the number of direct DOM manipulations. Whenever there is a change in the state of a component, React creates a new virtual DOM tree and compares it with the old one. The differences between the two are then calculated, and only those changes are made to the real DOM. This approach significantly improves the performance of the application.",

    "tag": "react"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is state in React and how is it used?",
    "answer": "State in React is an object that represents the current state of a component. It is used to manage the data that changes over time and triggers the rendering of the UI when the state changes. State is mutable, and it can only be modified using the setState method.",
    "tag": "react"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between state and props in React?",
    "answer": "State is used to manage data that can change within a component, while props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. State is mutable and can be updated within the component, while props are read-only.",
    "tag": "react"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the significance of keys in React?",
    "answer": "Keys are used to uniquely identify elements in a list of components. They help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed in a list, making the rendering process more efficient.",
    "tag": "react"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the virtual DOM in React?",
    "answer": "The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM that React uses to manage and update the UI efficiently. When a component’s state or props change, React creates a new virtual DOM tree, compares it to the old one, and updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM.",
    "tag": "react"
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the lifecycle methods in React?",
    "answer": "Lifecycle methods are methods that are called at different stages of a component’s life cycle, such as when it is mounted, updated, or unmounted. They can be used to perform actions like fetching data, updating the state, or cleaning up resources.",

  {
    "question": "How can you optimize the performance of a React application?",
    "answer": "Some ways to optimize the performance of a React application include using the virtual DOM, avoiding unnecessary renders, using lazy loading, and minimizing the number of HTTP requests. You can also use tools like React Profiler and DevTools to identify and fix performance issues.",
    "tag": "react"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the difference between a functional component and a class component in React?",
    "answer": "Functional components are stateless and use a function to render the UI. They are simpler and easier to write than class components, but cannot use state or lifecycle methods. Class components, on the other hand, use a class to define the component and can use state and lifecycle methods.",
    "tag": "react"

  },
  {
    "question": "What are controlled components in React?",
    "answer": "Controlled components are React components that are controlled entirely by the state of the parent component. The state of a controlled component is passed down to the child component as props, and the child component cannot modify its state directly. Instead, it must notify the parent component of any changes, which then updates the state of the controlled component.",
